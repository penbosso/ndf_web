          <strong>Product Information</strong>
        </li>
        <p>
          The Ghana Legal Timber Market App stores and processes personal data
          that you have provided to us, in order to provide our service. It’s
          your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the App secure.
          We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone,
          which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations
          imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make
          your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
          compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the
          Ghana Legal Timber Market App would not work properly or at all.

          <strong>Prohibited Conduct</strong>

        <div class="mb-3">
          You agree to use the App in accordance with these Terms and applicable
          laws and regulations. You will not violate any applicable law,
          intellectual property or other third-party right or commit a tort and
          you are solely responsible for your conduct while accessing or using
          the App. In connection with your use of the App and Services, you will
          not:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Engage in any harassing, threatening, intimidating, predatory or
              stalking conduct;

              from that user
            </li>
            <li>
              Develop or use any third-party applications that interact with the
              App or site without our prior written consent, including any

        <p>
          You should be aware that there are certain things that Nature &
          Development Foundation (NDF) will not take responsibility for. Certain
          functions of the App will require the App to have an active internet
          connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile
          network provider, but Nature & Development Foundation cannot take
          responsibility for the App not working at full functionality if you do
          not have access to Wi-Fi, and you do not have any of your data
          allowance left.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
          remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
          provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
          mobile services provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
          connection while accessing the App, or other third party charges. In
          using the App, you are accepting responsibility for any such charges,
          including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home
          territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
          If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using
          the App, it is presumed that you have received permission from the
          bill payer for using the App.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along the same lines, Nature & Development Foundation cannot take
          responsibility for the way you use the App i.e. you need to make sure
          that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you
          can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Nature & Development Foundation
          cannot accept responsibility.
        </p>

        <li>
          <strong>Disclaimer of Liability </strong>
        </li>
        <p>
          With respect to Nature & Development Foundation’s responsibility for
          your use of the App, when you’re using the App, it’s important to bear
          in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and
          correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
          information to us so that we can make it available to you. In
          addition, we do not and cannot vouch for the credibility of any timber
          company on the platform. However, all timber companies listed in the
          App for the time being were approved by the Timber Industry
          Development Division of the Forestry Commission as operating legally
          and selling legal timber. Nature & Development Foundation accepts no
          liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a
          result of relying wholly on this functionality of the App.
